# Math Structure Breakdown

A collection of math problems explained through **structure**, not tricks.

This repo focuses on:
- clean, minimal explanations  
- breaking problems into **paths** and **key steps**  
- showing *why* a problem feels hard  
- identifying hidden patterns behind solutions  

Each problem includes:
1. The original statement  
2. A short summary of standard solutions  
3. A structural breakdown (my approach)  
4. Key insights / why humans get stuck  
5. Optional small diagrams or scripts  

This project is meant to build a better way to understand math:  
**structure first, technique second.**

More problems coming soon.
